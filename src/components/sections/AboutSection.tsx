        currently studying at School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST). I was previously 
        studying at Tampines Primary School (TPPS) where I was a prefect there, and joined their 
        floorball CCA, whilst in secondary school, I joined the Show Choir and Dance CCA (the dance 
        side as we practice separately).
